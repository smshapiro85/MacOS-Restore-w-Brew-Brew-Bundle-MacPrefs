# MacOS-Restore-w-Brew-Brew-Bundle-MacPrefs
A script to restore a variety of preferences, app preferences, apps and app store apps, primarily using Brew

About: I've always despised the MacOS restore process, so I compiled a script that restores a variety of functionality to MacOS. This is my personal script so you'll want to download it and modify it to your liking.

What this script does:

1. Updates system preferences
2. Installs Homebrew, Brew Bundle, Python, App Store MAS (for installing app store apps), and MacPrefs for restoring additional app preferences
3. Runs a brew bundle to restore brew apps and app store apps
4. Updates some one-off app preferences for Safari, Text Edit and the App Store
5. Last manual step to install Python 2.7 specifically in order to allow usage of [macprefs](https://github.com/clintmod/macprefs/issues)
